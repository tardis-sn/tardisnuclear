Installation
************

``tardisnuclear`` has several dependencies that are easiest installed via
 `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ and all further instructions will
 assume that you use that for your installation. The first package that needs
 to be installed is pyne::

    conda install -c cyclus -c pyne pyne=0.5.0
