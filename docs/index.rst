TARDIS Nuclear
==============

TARDIS Nuclear is a framework to calculate the energy budget from nuclear
decay in supernovae. It is a companion package to the TARDIS SN radiative
transfer code and in the future these packages are intended to work together.
Furthermore, this code can be used to calculate simple bolometric lightcurves.
